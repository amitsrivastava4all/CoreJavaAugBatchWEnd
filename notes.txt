Exception Handling

Exception is a class
When Ever Exception is generated , internally java create
An object of exception.
And this object is throw to the JVM.
JVM will crash the application.
ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException, FileNotFoundException all these are predefine classes.

try{
Int e = 10/0;

}
catch(ArithmeticException e){
System.exit(0);
}
finally{
// Always execute Code either exception is coming or not
// resource clean up code
}

If we want our application cannot crash so we will catch the exception object before it reach to JVM.
So catch and handle it.
